# Sink 'Em Fast - Build Plan

## Recent Changes

### Testing & Optimization
- Installed testing frameworks: Vitest, React Testing Library, jsdom
- Configured Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.setup.ts`)
- Added test scripts to `package.json` (`test`, `test:watch`)
- Extracted core game logic into `src/lib/game-logic.ts`:
  - `validateShipPlacement`
  - `validateShot`
  - `checkShot` (handles hit, sunk, win)
- Created shared types file `src/lib/types.ts`
- Wrote unit tests for:
  - Ship placement validation
  - Shot validation
  - Hit/miss/sunk/win detection
- Wrote component tests for `GameBoard` using React Testing Library:
  - Verified grid rendering
  - Verified ship/hit/miss display
  - Tested click handling and turn logic
- Updated `tsconfig.json` for Vitest types
- Refactored `server.ts` to use extracted game logic functions
- Set up initial integration test structure (`game-flow.test.ts`):
  - Installed and configured `socket.io-mock`
  - Created basic Prisma client mock
  - Added tests for game creation and joining flow

### Game State Persistence & Reconnection
- Updated database schema for detailed game state:
  - Ship positions (JSON on Player)
  - Shot history (Shot model)
  - Game progress (status, currentTurnPlayerId, winnerPlayerId on Game)
- Implemented game state saving during play:
  - Ship placements saved on 'ships_placed' event
  - Shots saved on 'fire_shot' event
  - Turn changes saved after each shot
  - Winner saved on game over
  - Game status updated on player disconnect
- Implemented game state recovery on reconnection:
  - Fetch full game state from DB on player join/rejoin attempt
  - Reconstruct in-memory game state from DB if needed
  - Match players to existing DB state even with new socket IDs
  - Emit latest full state (ships, shots, turn, status) to rejoining player
  - Handle disconnections gracefully, allowing a window for reconnection

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added animations for:
  - Hits and misses using Framer Motion
- Added sound effects for:
  - Shot fired
  - Hit
  - Miss
  - Ship sunk
  - Game win
  - Game lose

### Game Board Implementation
- Created GameBoard component with:
  - Grid coordinate system (A-J, 1-10)
  - Cell state visualization (water, ship, hit, miss)
  - Hover effects for targeting
  - Click handling for shots
  - Ship visualization
  - Hit/miss markers
  - Fog of war for opponent's board
  - Turn indicator
  - Visual feedback for valid targets

### Game Logic Implementation
- Added shot system:
  - Shot validation
  - Hit/miss detection
  - Ship damage tracking
  - Turn management
- Implemented ship status tracking:
  - Hit counting
  - Ship sinking detection
  - Win condition checking
- Added real-time game updates:
  - Shot fired events
  - Hit/miss results
  - Turn changes
  - Ship sunk notifications
  - Game over detection

### Ship Placement Phase Implementation
- Created ShipPlacement component with drag-and-drop functionality using @dnd-kit
- Added ship rotation capability with visual feedback
- Implemented placement validation rules:
  - Ship boundary checks
  - Overlap detection
  - Grid size constraints
- Added visual feedback for valid/invalid placements
- Created game page with dynamic ship placement phase
- Added WebSocket events for ship placement synchronization
- Implemented server-side validation for ship placement
- Added ready state tracking for both players
- Added opponent notifications for placement status

### Database Integration
- Added Prisma schema with Game, Player, and Shot models
- Set up SQLite database for development
- Implemented database client with proper global instance handling
- Games and players are now persisted in the database
- Added ship placement state tracking in both memory and database
- Implemented game status transitions (WAITING â†’ PLACING_SHIPS â†’ ACTIVE â†’ FINISHED)

### WebSocket Implementation
- Implemented real-time game creation and joining using Socket.IO
- Added proper room management for game sessions
- Implemented player reconnection handling (robust)
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation
- Game state is now synchronized between memory and database
- Added events for:
  - Game creation
  - Player joining
  - Ship placement
  - Game state updates
  - Shot firing
  - Hit/miss results
  - Ship sinking
  - Game over
  - Player disconnection

### Game State Management
- Games track status through multiple phases:
  - WAITING: Initial game creation
  - PLACING_SHIPS: Players placing their ships
  - ACTIVE: Game in progress
  - FINISHED: Game completed or abandoned
- Players are tracked with both database IDs and socket IDs
- Game status updates are persisted in both memory and database
- Proper cleanup on player disconnection
- Added ship placement state tracking
- Implemented ready state synchronization
- Added turn management
- Track shot history and ship damage

### Frontend Features
- Real-time game code generation
- Join game functionality with input validation
- Loading states during API calls
- Toast notifications for:
  - Game creation
  - Player joining
  - Ship placement
  - Shot results
  - Ship sinking

  - Errors
- Automatic navigation when game is ready
- Input formatting (uppercase game codes)
- Proper button disable states
- Ship placement UI with:
  - Drag-and-drop functionality
  - Ship rotation
  - Visual placement validation
  - Grid visualization
  - Ship inventory management
- Game boards with:
  - Player and opponent views
  - Shot tracking

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing & Optimization (Current Focus)
- [X] Unit tests for:
  - [X] Game logic (hit/miss, sunk, win)
  - [X] Ship placement validation
  - [X] Shot validation
- [*] Integration tests for game flow (e.g., using mock sockets)
  - [X] Setup with `socket.io-mock` and Prisma mock
  - [X] Test game creation & join flow
  - [ ] Test ship placement flow
  - [ ] Test shooting sequence (hit/miss/sunk/win)
