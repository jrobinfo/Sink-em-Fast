# **App Name**: Sink 'Em Fast

## Core Features:

- Game Code Generation/Join: Generate a unique game code for friends to join a specific game, or join a random game if no code is entered.
- Ship Placement: Allow players to strategically place their ships on a grid-based board. Remember opponents ships are hidden and their location is unknown.
- Turn-Based Guessing: Enable players to take turns guessing the coordinates of the opponent's ships and provide feedback (hit or miss).
- Real-Time Game Board: Display the game board for each player, showing hits, misses, and sunk ships in real-time.
- AI-Powered Tagline: When a player sinks an opponent's ship, use an AI model tool to generate a fun, personalized 'You sunk my battleship!' message incorporating game-specific data (e.g., ship type, number of hits taken).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sea blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a naval theme.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for the grid and background elements.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF8C00) to highlight hits and important actions.
- Clean and intuitive grid layout optimized for mobile devices.
- Use simple icons to represent ships and game actions (e.g., target icon for attack, ship icon for placement).
- Subtle animations for hits, misses, and sinking ships to enhance the user experience.

## Original User Request:
Build an app based on the popular game Battleship. However, this will not be played offline. This is a web application that should be mobile-friendly and designed for people to play quick, fun games online with each other. Friends should be able to share a code with another user or friend to quickly join a game. If a user doesn't have a friend, they should be able to play with a random stranger. Be sure to include the popular tagline: "You sunk my battleship." The game should be enjoyable, with a viral aspect and quick social interactions.
